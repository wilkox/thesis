\caption[Results of \softwarename{minspec} validate]{Results of repeated trials of \softwarename{minspec} on simulated metagenomic studies with multiple permutations of parameters (number of reads, number of simulated \acp{OTU}, size of simulated assemblage).
The number of simulated \acp{OTU} and size of simulated assemblage are represented as a ratio on the z-axis (``assemblage / all OTUs'').
Each permutation was repeated five times.
A plane representing a linear regression has been overlaid on each plot to indicate the trend.
Points have been tinted to aid the perception of depth; colour is not otherwise meaningful.
