Three samples of \ac{AABW} were opportunistically obtained and analysed during the project described in \secreft{ch:polarfront} \figref{fig:deepsamplemap}.
Two of these samples (356 and 361) were of newly formed \ac{AABW} waters on the Antarctic continental shelf, while one (365) was of abyssal \ac{AABW} from the South Australian basin \tabref{tab:deepsamples}.
DNA extraction, sequencing and construction of a taxonomic profile by \softwarename{blast} comparison to the RefSeq database and processing with \ac{GAAS} were performed using the methods described in \secreft{ch:polarfront}.
A standardised and log-transformed Bray-Curtis resemblance matrix was constructed including the taxonomic profiles of the \ac{AABW} samples as well as the \ac{NZ} and \ac{SZ} samples described in \secreft{ch:polarfront}.
A \ac{nMDS} plot was then constructed from this matrix.
All statistical procedures were performed in \softwarename{PRIMER 6} as described by \citet{Clarke:2001ut}.

\section{Results and Discussion}

Although the three \ac{AABW} samples were taken in deep, cold and aphotic waters \tabref{tab:deepsamples} compared to the surface \ac{AZ} and \ac{SZ} samples, the \ac{nMDS} plot suggested that the two continental shelf \ac{AABW} samples (356 and 361) were surprisingly similar to those of the \ac{AZ}, particularly sample 353 \figref{fig:deepnmds}.
Further, the indicated the presence of several \acp{OTU} which would not be expected to be present at significant abundance in deep, aphotic waters \tabref{tab:topdeepotus}.
For example, \species{Roseobacter denitrificans} OCh 114, a model organism for aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis, was the fifth most abundant \ac{OTU} across the three \ac{AABW} samples.
Numerous \ac{CFB} representatives, typically associated with \ac{POM} and the utilisation of \ac{HMW} phytoplankton products, were also unexpectedly high.

A possible explanation for these observations is that the continental shelf samples represent \ac{AABW} recently formed in the D'Urville sea, and the observed assemblage therefore represents advection rather than selection by environmental factors.
The project described in \secreft{ch:advection} was designed to test and explore this hypothesis.
