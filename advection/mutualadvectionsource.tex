  \caption[Samples with a mutual advective source]{It is possible that some sample sites (black) share a close mutual advective source (red), but are not themselves closely connected by advection. Even if the shared advective origin was causing these samples to have very similar microbial communities, this would not be measurable with this study's methods.}
