\chapter[Deep water formation]{Preliminary analysis of \ac{AABW} samples suggests advective transport of microbial cells}
\label{ch:deepwaterformation}

\section{Abstract}

During sampling for the study presented in \secreft{ch:polarfront}, additional samples were collected of \ac{AABW} on the Antarctic continental shelf and from the sea floor in the vicinity of the mid-ocean ridge.
Metagenomic analysis found that the community composition of the continental shelf samples was surprisingly similar to that of surface samples in the same area, despite the significant differences in environmental factors such as pressure and light availability.
This may have resulted from the rapid advection of cells in the sinking of surface waters to form \ac{AABW} (deep water formation; see \secreft{ch:intro}).
These results led to the study described in \secreft{ch:advection}.

\section{Methods}

Three samples of \ac{AABW} were opportunistically obtained and analysed during the project described in \secreft{ch:polarfront} \figref{fig:deepsamplemap}.
Two of these samples (356 and 361) were of newly formed \ac{AABW} waters on the Antarctic continental shelf, while one (365) was of abyssal \ac{AABW} from the South Australian basin \tabref{tab:deepsamples}.
DNA extraction, sequencing and construction of a taxonomic profile by \softwarename{blast} comparison to the RefSeq database and processing with \ac{GAAS} were performed using the methods described in \secreft{ch:polarfront}.
A standardised and log-transformed Bray-Curtis resemblance matrix was constructed including the taxonomic profiles of the \ac{AABW} samples as well as the \ac{NZ} and \ac{SZ} samples described in \secreft{ch:polarfront}.
A \ac{nMDS} plot was then constructed from this matrix.
All statistical procedures were performed in \softwarename{PRIMER 6} as described by \citet{Clarke:2001ut}.

\section{Results and Discussion}

Although the three \ac{AABW} samples were taken in deep, cold and aphotic waters \tabref{tab:deepsamples} compared to the surface \ac{AZ} and \ac{SZ} samples, the \ac{nMDS} plot suggested that the two continental shelf \ac{AABW} samples (356 and 361) were surprisingly similar to those of the \ac{AZ}, particularly sample 353 \figref{fig:deepnmds}.
Further, the indicated the presence of several \acp{OTU} which would not be expected to be present at significant abundance in deep, aphotic waters \tabref{tab:topdeepotus}.
For example, \species{Roseobacter denitrificans} OCh 114, a model organism for aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis, was the fifth most abundant \ac{OTU} of the continental shelf samples.
Numerous \ac{CFB} representatives, typically associated with \ac{POM} and the utilisation of \ac{HMW} phytoplankton products \citep[e.g.][]{Williams:2012gsa}, were also unexpectedly high.

A possible explanation for these observations is that the continental shelf samples represent \ac{AABW} recently formed in the D'Urville sea, and the observed assemblage therefore represents advection rather than selection by environmental factors.
The project described in \secreft{ch:advection} was designed to test and explore this hypothesis.
