\section{Methods}
\subsection{Sampling and metagenomic sequencing}

Sampling\footnote{Sampling was performed by Jeffrey M. Hoffman and Jeffrey B. Mcquaid} was conducted on board the RSV \emph{Aurora Australis} during cruise V3 CEAMARC/CASO (Collaborative East Antarctic Marine Census / Climate of Southern Ocean) from 13 December 2007 -- 26 January 2008. 
This cruise occupied the SR3 latitudinal transect from Hobart, Australia (44$^\circ$ S) to the Mertz Glacier, Antarctica (67$^\circ$ S) within a longitudinal range of 140--150$^\circ$ E.
Nineteen samples (16 surface, 3 deep) were obtained along almost the entire latitudinal range \figref{fig:samplemap}.

At each station, $\sim$ 500 L of seawater was pumped from $\sim$ 2 m below the sea surface into drums stored at ambient temperature on deck. 
In the case of deep samples, $\sim$ 10--50 L of seawater was collected opportunistically from Niskin bottles attached to a CTD (Conductivity, Temperature and Depth) instument operated by an unrelated oceanographic project.
Seawater samples were prefiltered through a 20 $\mu$m plankton net, then filtrate was captured on sequential 3.0 $\mu$m, 0.8 $\mu$m and 0.1 $\mu$m polyethersulfone membrane filters (Supor membrane disc filter; Pall Life Sciences), and immediately stored at $-20$ $^\circ$C \cite{Rusch:2007ez,Ng:2010cd}.
