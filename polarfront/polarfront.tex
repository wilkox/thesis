\section{Methods}
\subsection{Sampling and metagenomic sequencing}

Sampling\footnote{Sampling was performed by Jeffrey M. Hoffman and Jeffrey B. Mcquaid} was conducted on board the RSV \emph{Aurora Australis} during cruise V3 CEAMARC/CASO (Collaborative East Antarctic Marine Census / Climate of Southern Ocean) from 13 December 2007 -- 26 January 2008. 
This cruise occupied the SR3 latitudinal transect from Hobart, Australia (44\textdegree S) to the Mertz Glacier, Antarctica (67\textdegree S) within a longitudinal range of 140--150\textdegree E.
Nineteen samples (16 surface, 3 deep) were obtained along almost the entire latitudinal range \figref{fig:samplemap}.

A range of data were recorded by integrated instruments on the RSV \emph{Aurora Australis} including location, water column depth, water temperature, salinity, fluorescence and meterological data (TODO provide table).
These data were used to locate the (TODO abbreviations package? PFZ) based on a surface temperature gradient of $\sim$ 1.35 \textdegree{}C across a distance of 45--65 km, placing the (TODO abbreviations? PF) at approximately $-59.70$\textdegree of latitude, consistant with previous descriptions TODO EDITING HERE NEED SOKOLOV AND RINTOUL REF

At each station, $\sim$ 250--560 L of seawater was pumped from $\sim$ 1.5--2.5 m below the sea surface into drums stored at ambient temperature on deck. 
In the case of deep samples, $\sim$ 225--230 L of seawater was collected opportunistically from Niskin bottles attached to a CTD (Conductivity, Temperature and Depth TODO give infor on CTD - SeaBird?) instument operated by an unrelated oceanographic project.
Seawater samples were prefiltered through a 20 \textmu{}m plankton net, then filtrate was captured on sequential 3.0 \textmu{}m, 0.8 \textmu{}m and 0.1 \textmu{}m polyethersulfone membrane filters (Supor membrane disc filter; Pall Life Sciences TODO location), and immediately stored at $-20$ $^\circ$C \cite{Rusch:2007ez,Ng:2010cd}.

DNA extraction\footnote{DNA extraction was performed by Cynthia Andrews-Pfannkoch and others at the J. Craig Venter Institute} was performed at the J. Craig Venter Institute (Rockville, USA) as described in \citet{Rusch:2007ez}.
Pyrosequencing was performed on a GS20 FLX Titanium instrument (Roche, Branford, USA) also at the J. Craig Venter Institute as described in \citet{Lauro:2010jna}.
Duplicate reads and reads with many pyrosequencing errors were removed as described in \citet{Lauro:2010jna}.
