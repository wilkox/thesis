  \caption[Tree of GSO-EOSA-1 related 16S rRNA genes]{
  Neighbour-joining tree of GSO-EOSA-1-like 16S rRNA gene sequences from the metagenomes in this study.
  Sequences labeled in black text are reads from the metagenomes.
  Red labels are 16S rRNA gene sequences from Gammaproteobacterial Sulfur Oxidizers (GSO) and other Gammaproteobacteria.
  The tree was constructed using \softwarename{arb} \cite{Ludwig:2004dg}.
