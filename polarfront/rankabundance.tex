  \caption[Rank-abundance curves for \acp{OTU} in each zone and size fraction]{Rank-abundance curves for \acp{OTU} identified in each zone and size fraction. The dominance of a given OTU is its relative abundance as a percentage of all identified \acp{OTU}. The x-axis is scaled logarithmically. Generated using \softwarename{PRIMER 6}.}
