  \caption[Rank-abundance curves for OTUs in each zone and size fraction]{Rank-abundance curves for OTUs identified in each zone and size fraction. The dominance of a given OTU is calculated as its relative abundance as a percentage of the relative abundance of all identified OTUs. The x-axis is scaled logarithmically.}
