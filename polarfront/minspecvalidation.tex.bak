\caption[Results of \softwarename{minspec} validate]{Results of repeated trials of \softwarename{minspec} on simulated metagenomic studies with multiple permutations of parameters (number of reads, number of simulated taxa, size of simulated assemblage).
The number of simulated taxa and size of simulated assemblage are representated as a ratio on the z-axis (``assemblage / all taxa'').
Each permutation was repeated five times.
A plane representing a linear regression has been overlayed on each plot to indicate the trend.
Points have been tinted to aid the perception of depth; colour is not otherwise meaningful.
