\caption[Summing relative abundances across size fractions]{An example of distortion introduced by summing OTU relative abundances across size fractions. The red OTU composes only 15\% of the total number of cells captured (a). However, it is enriched (80\%) in the 3.0 \micron{} fraction (b). If the relative abundances are simply summed, the red OTU appears to compose 32\% of the community, more than twice the correct value (c). Without cell counts for each fraction, relative abundances cannot be summed between the fractions.}
