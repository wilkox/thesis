\chapter{Preliminary analysis of \ac{AABW} samples}

\section{Introduction and Methods}
\input{../biogeog/deepsamples}
Three samples of \ac{AABW} were opportunistically obtained and analysed during the project described in \secreft{ch:polarfront}.
Two of these samples (356 and 361) were of newly formed \ac{AABW} waters on the Antarctic continental shelf, while one (365) was of abyssal \ac{AABW} from the South Australian basin \tabref{tab:deepsamples}.
DNA extraction, sequencing and construction of a taxonomic profile by \softwarename{blast} comparison to the RefSeq database were performed using the methods described in \secreft{ch:polarfront}.
A standardised and log-transformed Bray-Curtis resemblance matrix was constructed including the taxonomic profiles of the \ac{AABW} samples as well as the \ac{NZ} and \ac{SZ} samples described in \secreft{ch:polarfront}.
A \ac{nMDS} plot was then constructed from this matrix.
All statistical procedures were performed in \softwarename{PRIMER 6} as described by \citet{Clarke:2001ut}.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\input{../biogeog/deepnmds.tex}

Although the three \ac{AABW} samples were taken in deep, cold and aphotic waters \tabref{tab:deepsamples} compared to the surface \ac{AZ} and \ac{SZ} samples, the \ac{nMDS} plot suggested that the two continental shelf \ac{AABW} samples (356 and 361) were surprisingly similar to those of the \ac{AZ}, particularly sample 353 \figref{fig:deepnmds}.
