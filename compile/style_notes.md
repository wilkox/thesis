#Adding words to the aspell dictionary
- This should be done pragmatically. There should be no hesitation in adding a non-word token ("TODO"; the "SAR" from "SAR11") so it will not be flagged again. The only exception should be if the token is a likely misspelling in another context. Remember, the custom dictionary can always be manually edited later and aspell is an assistive rather than authoritative proofreading tool.

#Scientific names
- Capitalise, but do not italicise, ranks higher than genus.
- Derived forms of any rank are non-italicised and lower case ("alphaproteobacterial"; "gammaproteobacterium").
- While it could be considered that referring to the set of organisms, rather than to the rank itself, is a derived form (so "the sample was full of flavobacteria"), for consistency's sake the capitalised form will always be used ("some Gammaproteobacteria are methane oxidisers"). No rank should not appear anywhere uncapitalised.
- After Buchan et al. 2005: roseobacters (no italics) is acceptable for referring to members of the clade Roseobacter. Note that Buchan et al. italicise Roseobacter, but I will avoid this as it misleadingly implies the genus of the same name.
- Regarding spelling: as I'm using a custom dictionary, storing Latin names as well as the text parts of clade names (e.g. the "SAR" from "SAR11") in aspell is acceptable, although of course the spelling should be checked before adding.
- Giving a rank without an article refers to that rank ("Verrucomicrobia is a recently described bacterial phylum"), while adding an article indicates a representative or representatives of the rank ("The Verrucomicrobia found in the first sample were absent from the second").
- It is acceptable to refer to members of the domains Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya as bacteria, archaea and eukarya respectively.

#Gene and protein names
- Rather than futilely attempting to apply a universal style, gene names should be copied faithfully from the source, including capitalisation and italicisation or lack thereof. Where sources disagree, one should be selected as authoritative and its style consistently applied. 
- As I'm using a custom dictionary, storing gene and protein names in aspell is fine.
- Chlorophyll a: the word "chlorophyll" should always be in roman type; the "a" should be in italics. The abbreviated form is "chl a", with the "a" in italics.

#Metagenomes and metagenomics
- Neither term is a proper noun.
- A metagenome is the genetic material recovered from an environmental sample.
- There is no need to say "metagenomic dataset" or "set of metagenomic sequences" where merely "metagenome" will do.

#American, British and Australian English
- As a general rule, Australian English spellings should be used: so "oxidise" rather than "oxidize".
- However, an exception can be made when the word forms part of a name already in the literature: so the GSO are the "Gammaproteobacterial Sulfur Oxidizers".

#Units of measurement
- Base pairs: bp; kbp = kilo base pairs, Mbp = mega base pairs; Gbp = giga base pairs

#Quotation marks
- Double quotation marks, typeset using LaTeX's "``" and "''" commands, should always be used for quotations.
