#Adding words to the aspell dictionary
- This should be done pragmatically. There should be no hesitation in adding a non-word token ("TODO"; the "SAR" from "SAR11") so it will not be flagged again. The only exception should be if the token is a likely misspelling in another context. Remember, the custom dictionary can always be manually edited later and aspell is an assistive rather than authoritative proofreading tool.

#Scientific names
- Capitalise, but do not italicise, ranks higher than genus.
- Derived forms of any rank are non-italicised and lower case ("alphaproteobacterial"; "gammaproteobacterium").
- After Buchan et al. 2005: roseobacters (no italics) is acceptable for referring to members of the clade Roseobacter. Note that Buchan et al. italicise Roseobacter, but I will avoid this as it misleadingly implies the genus.
- Regarding spelling: as I'm using a custom dictionary, storing Latin names as well as the text parts of clade names (e.g. the "SAR" from "SAR11") in aspell is acceptable, although of course the spelling should be checked before adding.
- Giving a rank without an article refers to that rank ("Verrucomicrobia is a recently described bacterial phylum"), while adding an article indicates a representative or representatives of the rank ("The Verrucomicrobia found in the first sample were absent from the second").

#Gene and protein names
- Rather than futilely attempting to apply a universal style, gene names should be copied faithfully from the source, including capitalisation and italicisation or lack thereof. Where sources disagree, one should be selected as authoritative and its style consistently applied. 
- As I'm using a custom dictionary, storing gene and protein names in apsell is fine.
