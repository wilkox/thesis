The biogeographic distribution of microorganisms is an important part of their ecology, as it is both a cause and a consequence of the interaction between microbes and their environment.
In the Southern Ocean (SO), physical oceanographic features such as water masses and their circulation are closely associated with microbial biogeography, but this relationship has not been previously desribed on a large scale and at the whole-community level and the effects of climate change on the SO's physical stutre
